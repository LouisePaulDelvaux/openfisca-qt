OpenFisca
=========

[obsolete]

This is the desktop version of OpenFisca which is now obsolete. It is no longer maintained. The socio-fiscal model included in this repository has not been updated for legislation since 2013.

The installation of the current version is described here: http://www.openfisca.fr/installation

However, this version includes features that are not yet present in the new web version, in particular the management of survey data. This may justify its use in some cases for demonstration purposes.
